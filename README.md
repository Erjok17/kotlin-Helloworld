# Overview

This project is a simple Kotlin application that marks the beginning of my journey into modern JVM languages. As an aspiring software engineer, I'm using this exercise to validate my development environment setup and establish best practices for future Kotlin projects, including an upcoming flag quiz app.

The software prints a customized "Hello World" message with emoji support, demonstrating basic Kotlin syntax and runtime execution. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Kotlin to eventually create interactive CLI and Android applications.
